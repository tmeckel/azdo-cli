# Azure DevOps CLI

`azdo` is Azure DevOps on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and
other Azure DevOps concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with
`git` and your code.

Azure DevOps CLI is available for Azure DevOps organizations hosted in the
cloud. **Azure DevOps Server is not supported.**
